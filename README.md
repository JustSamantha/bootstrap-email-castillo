# Bootstrap Grid Project - Create a Responsive Email Template

## Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is limited to creating a design and web-page template with HTML and CSS. You can use the Javascript and animations from Bootstrap, but you do not need to add your own JavaScript to this web-page. If you would like to add some of your own JavaScript to add more functionality to the web-page you may, but it is not necessary.

The web-page does not need to be a functioning web-application. You do not need to create a real functioning website or app, it just needs to be a simple HTML page template that is RESPONSIVE.

The web page needs to be made using Bootstrap Grid. Bootstrap Grid is the grid system available in Bootstrap Library for building responsive page layouts. You should not use CSS grid. You will be able to accomplish this project with the Bootstrap library, and the classes that it has available. You are allowed to use any web-components from Bootstrap Library you would like. Feel free to look at Bootstrap’s examples, but please spend time making some of your own designs and adjusting your components, and don’t just put in the bare minimum of effort copying and pasting in components from Bootstrap’s Website.

Your project should be designed first how it will appear on mobile screens, then how it will appear on half a screen/tablet view, and then how it will appear on Desktop Fullscreen (1920 X 1080 pixels)

The project will be broken up into multiple parts, which will each have specific due dates.

If you are unable to finish your project drafts by the due dates you are required to message your instructor VIA Discord at least 2 days before the due date to ask for an extension. Be proactive and front load the work. If you need help, ask for help as soon as possible. Ask other students, or your study group, or your instructor to set up study sessions for getting help with your project.

You will be required to create and maintain a development log (google document) summarizing your work progress and any resources you used.

You will be required to show your project and talk about it in front of the class and in small groups, so please come prepared to class on days where there will be code reviews. You should prepare to show, and explain and talk about your project. The Questions you will need to answer will be provided.

You are welcome to make multiple designs, in fact I highly encourage students to make at least 2 or more designs for this project for good practice.
